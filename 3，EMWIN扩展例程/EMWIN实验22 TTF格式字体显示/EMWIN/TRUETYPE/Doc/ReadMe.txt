Notes on the TrueType Library
=============================

The FreeType 2 font engine located in the folder GUI\TrueType is derived
work based on the FreeType  Project,  copyright (C) 1996-2000  by  David
Turner,Robert Wilhelm and Werner Lemberg and is used by SEGGER under the
terms of the enclosed Free Type License (FTL.TXT).

The  FreeType 2 font  engine can be used and  distributed free of charge 
under one of the  two licenses described below:

  - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
    to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
    you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
    documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
    is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
    License.

  - The GNU  General Public License  version 2, found in  `GPL.TXT' (any
    later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
    GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible with the  GPL due  to its
    advertisement clause.

The  contributed  PCF and  BDF drivers are FreeType font drivers and are 
used by  SEGGER  under the  terms of the  enclosed licenses (PCF.TXT and 
BDF.TXT), similar to the X Window System,and can be used and distributed
free of charge according to above mentioned FTL and GPL licenses.
